Pet Friend.ly is a social network with a specific feature for pet adoption. We used insights from a friend who has an NGO for rescuing animals to build it, acting like a PO on the Project, choosing what features to implement and how they needed to be. It was developed in one week during the 9th week of the Ironhack Web Development Bootcamp as a final project.
